## 1. Anticipatory Repudiation

### Definition

Anticipatory repudiation occurs when, **before performance is due**, one party to a contract
clearly demonstrates, by words or conduct, an intention not to perform its contractual obligations.

The Ontario Court of Appeal articulated the doctrine as follows:

> “An anticipatory breach of contract occurs when one party to a contract, by express language or
> conduct, or as a matter of implication from what it has said or done, repudiates its contractual
> obligations before they fall due.”
>
> — *Ali v. O-Two Medical Technologies Inc.*, 2013 ONCA 733 at para 22  
> citing G.H.L. Fridman, *The Law of Contract in Canada*, 6th ed.

### Election by the Innocent Party

An anticipatory repudiation does not, by itself, terminate the contract. Once repudiation is
communicated, the innocent party has an election:

1. **Accept the repudiation** and sue immediately for damages; or
2. **Treat the contract as continuing**, insist on performance, and bring an action if performance
   ultimately fails to materialize.

See *Ali v. O-Two*, supra, at paras 23–24.

## 2. Actual Breach for Non-Performance

Once the contractual date for performance has passed and performance has not occurred, the
breach is no longer anticipatory. It becomes an **actual breach for non-performance**.

At that point:
- The election doctrine applicable to anticipatory repudiation is no longer engaged.
- The innocent party is entitled to pursue remedies for breach without awaiting further conduct.

Canadian courts treat failure to perform by the agreed time, where time is material or relied upon,
as a straightforward breach of contract.

## 3. Remedies for Breach of Contract

### Specific Performance

Specific performance is an equitable remedy and is granted only where damages are inadequate.

The Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized that specific performance is exceptional and requires
proof that the subject matter of the contract is **unique** or cannot reasonably be obtained elsewhere.

See *Semelhago v. Paramadevan*, [1996] 2 SCR 415.

For mass-produced, readily available goods, such as computer hardware or memory modules,
specific performance will generally not be available. Monetary damages are considered adequate.

---

### Damages as the Primary Remedy

The normal remedy for breach of contract is damages intended to place the innocent party in the
position they would have occupied had the contract been performed.

This includes losses that:
- Flow directly from the breach; and
- Were reasonably foreseeable at the time of contracting.

Price increases in replacement goods are a classic example of foreseeable loss following
non-delivery of goods.

## 4. Duty to Mitigate

Under Canadian law, a party claiming damages for breach of contract has a **duty to mitigate**.

This means the innocent party must take reasonable steps to reduce the loss resulting from the
breach. The duty does not require perfection, only reasonableness.

In the context of non-delivery of goods, mitigation commonly includes:
- Purchasing reasonably equivalent substitute goods; and
- Doing so within a reasonable time, rather than allowing losses to escalate.

The duty to mitigate exists where damages are sought, but mitigation also serves the practical
interest of both parties by preventing avoidable increases in loss.

If suitable substitute goods are available only at a higher market price, the resulting price
difference is generally recoverable, provided the substitute purchase was reasonable.

## 5. Contractual Terms and Performance Mechanics

Commercial sales agreements often contain clauses defining when an order is formally “accepted,”
for example upon shipment. Such clauses typically address **ordering mechanics** and risk
allocation prior to shipment.

Under Canadian contract law, these clauses do not grant a seller an unlimited right to delay
performance after:
- Delivery commitments have been made;
- The buyer has relied on those commitments; and
- The promised delivery dates have passed without performance.

Where an agreement expressly contemplates fulfillment through equivalent substitute goods, this
reinforces the existence of an obligation to perform, rather than a right to withhold performance
indefinitely.

---

## 6. Limitation Periods

Limitation statutes do not create substantive contract rights. They govern **when** a claim must be
brought once a cause of action arises.

For breach of contract, limitation periods typically begin to run when the breach is discovered,
which, in the case of non-delivery, is usually the missed delivery date.

Examples:
- *Limitations Act, 2002*, SO 2002, c 24, ss 4–5 (Ontario)
- *Limitation Act*, SBC 2012, c 13, ss 6–8 (British Columbia)

---

## 7. Summary

- Anticipatory repudiation applies only before performance is due.
- Once a delivery date has passed without performance, the breach is an actual breach.
- Specific performance is generally unavailable for mass-produced goods.
- Damages are the appropriate remedy.
- The innocent party has a duty to mitigate by obtaining reasonable substitutes.
- Reasonable replacement costs and resulting price differences are foreseeable and recoverable.
